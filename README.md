# PhantomZone
My personal video database on home NAS. Using NodeJS for file processing, React, Redux and jQuery in TypeScript for UI, and Firebase for on-line storage and real-time data access.

# Discontinued
This repo was discontinued, and converted to a new repo called "phantom-zone-create-react-app". As you can tell from the name, it was created using the official create-react-app bundler from Facebook. The reasons for doing so is that it requires little to none configuration, yet supports almost everything you need out of the box. The performance is also much better in terms of code minimisation. The production compilation is way smaller than what you can achieve by yourself with Webpack without having to go through pages of configuration just to get things going (create-react-app is using Webpack under the hood by the way).

So, for any updates, please visit the other repo.
