# React Playground
My own react resort. An application sandbox for apps and gadgets.

I tried to use reactstrap in the beginning, which required react-transition-group version 1 (npm i react-transition-group@^1). But it was not typescript-ready, and caused compilation errors, so I gave it up. Instead I just used the normal version of Bootstrap 4. For its CSS explanations refer to here https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp.
